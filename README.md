# Obsidian Chat

I want to be able to chat with "Obsidian", not some stranger.

I also have some expectations of how I want to interface with Obsidian Chat.

1. I want to be able to invoke a quick chat anywhere on any page.
2. I want to have multiple different chats going on on the same page.
3. I want the chat to look good (use callouts)
4. I want to get the chat settings boilerplate out of the current page.
